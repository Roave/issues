Goals
=====
    Our goal is to create a simple, lightweight, standalone issue tracking system, similar in style and functionality to Github issues. This issue tracking system is kept to a minimal set of flexible features and great care and consideration is to be taken before adding to the core feature set. The primary purpose of this project is to avoid the [feature creep](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_creep) which is common among many open source issue trackers availalbe today.

Features
========

* Open source
* Simple, fast, lightweight
* Extensible (coming soon)
* Extremely flexible permissions system (great for businesses)
* Single or multiple projects
* Milestones
* Color-coded labels/tags

Installation
============
Run docs/schema.sql on your database. The provided SQL is compatible with MySQL 5.1.

Special Thanks
==============
The generous work of the following people and projects helped make this software
possible:

* [Zend Framework](http://framework.zend.com/)
* [jQuery](http://jquery.com/)
* [Really Simple Color Picker](https://github.com/laktek/really-simple-color-picker) by [Lakshan Perera](http://laktek.com/). The color picker icon we use is a [modified](http://abeautifulsite.net/blog/2011/02/jquery-minicolors-a-color-selector-for-input-controls/) version of the ui-color-picker icon in the excellent [Fugue icon set](http://p.yusukekamiyamane.com/about/) by [Yusuke Kamiyamane](http://p.yusukekamiyamane.com/about/).
